# <center>Short Bio</center>

I am a 2nd year Mathematics PhD student at Purdue University - West Lafayette.

My research interests include Applied PDEs, specifically Forward & Inverse Scattering Problems.

Some topics that interest me:

- **Acoustic, Elastic, and Electromagnetic Wave Propagation in Complex Media**
- **Direct & Inverse Scattering Problems in Partial Differential Equations**
- **Finite Element Methods**
- **Applications to sonar imaging, geophysical exploration & nondestructive testing.**

I studied math and philosophy as an undergrad at Rutgers University. Additionally, I completed my MS in Applied Mathematics at New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), where I worked with Dr. Christina Frederick in direct and inverse scattering problems arising in underwater acoustics.
