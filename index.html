<p>
I'm a second-year math graduate student at Purdue. I'm broadly
interested in Partial Differential Equations and Inverse Scattering Problems
</p>
<p>
Outside of math, I spend a bunch of time doing creative writing and declamation/poetry, jogging, and enjoy discussing history and philosophy with others. In fact, I founded and organize the math history seminar here at Purdue. 

I was an undergraduate at Rutgers, where I studied mathematics and philosophy. Additionally, I completed an MS in Applied Mathematics at New Jersey Institute of Technology, where I was fortunate to be advised by Dr. Christina Frederick in forward and inverse problems arising in sonar.
